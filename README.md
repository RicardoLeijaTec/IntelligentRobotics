# IntelligentRobotics
Implementation of Intelligent Robotics course code developed for the team project.

Code file management made by my friend Alfredo García (mostly on his branch), all codes were developed by Ricardo Leija, Alfredo García and Gerardo Castañon.
The creation of this repo which was an idea of Alfredo made the workflow a lot easier.
